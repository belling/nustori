                        Nustori is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide a long form content experience. This site demonstrates a prerelease proof of concept version of Nustori. Consider this demo site a rough sketch. <a href="https://github.com/belling/nustori">Download from GitHub</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike the pattern of long form experiences being popularized by <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Medium</em>, <em>Verge</em>, and others, Nustori is looking to support traditionally visual storytelling forms, by augmenting them with text rather than the other way around.

                    <p>
                        Nustori was inspired by a desire to explore long form content presentation, coupled with my perception that small and non-profit media organzations could use a hand in engaging user experience design and web development. However the ultimate goal of the project is to produce a framework that may find uses in other visually-dynamic applications, including ecommerce,  narrative storytelling, blogging, and distance learning.

                    <h5>what's in this release?</h5>

                    <p>
                        The current version is the result of an organic "designing with html" process, resulting in some pretty messy CSS and JavaScript. The code does not adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles very well and is ripe for refactoring. But it does acheive some initial goals, as outlined below.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <section class="x-scroll">

                            <h5>stories in multiple dimensions</h5>
                            <p>
                                Stories no longer have to follow a linear path. They can have branches and related information that augment the content. This Nustori release delivers primary content on the y-axis (vertical), with secondary content on the x-axis (horizontal). The section you are reading now demonstrates x-axis navigation.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Strong imagery draws the audience into a story, making them more likely to engage with long form content. This release features a flexible image effect in which each section features an image that covers the full window, then crossfades to a transition image as the page scrolls.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Trying to guess the capabilities of the software or device a given audience member is using is a losing proposition. It's better for the site to adapt as best it can to diffent display environments. This release of Nustori was built using the <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton responsive grid boilerplate</a> to provide responsive adaptability.

                                    It's the first day of 2014 as I write this. HTML5 is still a candidate recommendation but much of it is decently supported in modern browsers and HTML 4 became a spec 16 years ago. It's time.
                                </p>

                                    With semantic HTML we don't need a super complex data model, because the presentation defines its own schema-less structure that is easily parsed and understood.

                                <p>
                                    People navigate in multiple ways. Sometimes they click a mouse, sometimes they turn a scrollwheel, sometimes they swipe their finger, sometimes they use their finger to tap. Nustori seeks to provide an obvious option that makes sense for whatever navigation input is being used.
                                </p>

                                    Because we are using the DOM for data definition, we can easily easily generate navigation elements on the fly with JavaScript.

                                This release of Nustori fetches every asset it needs on page load. Some of those assets are awfully big images that you aren't even going to see until you scroll a bit. They slow down the page load unnecessarily. The bigger and more complex the page gets, the worse this will be. The basic HTML structure is in place to load assets that are not being used at the moment asynchronously, via AJAX calls. Now it's just a matter of writing the JavaScript to do it.

                            <p>
                                We are at a turning point in the use of online multimedia. Video and audio online has typically been "boxed in" with embedded players, effectively giving us webpages with little TVs and CD players in them. With native HTML5 media elements, video and audio has become just another part of the page alongside text and graphics. Future releases of Nustori will address ways of presenting media content, both as background design and as central content. An intriguing path would be to flip common presentations entirely on their heads and create a video-first long form presentation in which the timing of the video provides core navigation through text and other ancillary material.

                                This demo site acheives photographic effects by loading two versions of each giant picture and then crossfading between them. That's dumb. Unfortunately CSS filter effects support in browsers hasn't progressed to the point where I can use them and only upload one giant picture instead of two. The day I can use them safely is not yet in site.

                                For more than a decade, lightweight, open-source backend web development has relied on combinations of Apache Web Server and PHP/Perl/Python/Etc. Meanwhile, enterprise backend web development has tended towards application development in Java/ASP.NET/Etc. With the emergence of Node.js, a remarkable thing is happening: JavaScript, the language of front end scripting, has also become a viable option for back end application development. This changes everything, and well it should. With projects like <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> being built with server-side JS, it's clear that this is where the serious work is headed.

                                is ever so much more enjoyable than writing
                                <code>
                                    document.getElementById('thing')
                                </code>
                                . But native JavaScript is faster and using it to write core Nustori functions would help speed things up.

                                I have no illusions about my coding skills. I'm competent, but I'm a liberal arts and communications guy, not a CS guy. Figuring out the best way to write plugins and themes in a web application is a little daunting to me, but I'm willing to give it a go. Or perhaps you want to help out? If so, get in touch through the <a href="https://github.com/belling/nustori">Nustori GitHub project</a>.

                        Traditional Content Management Systems are better at "management" than "content." The ultimate expression of Nustori's goals would be a jointly distributed back end web application and front end presentation. The back end architecture would stress loose coupling between the data layers and the presentation layer, avoiding the mixing of logic and formatting that is endemic to many projects for popular CMSes such as Drupal and WordPress.

                        Additionally, in the real world, many websites aren't simple and self-contained like this demo site. They are interconnected with external data sources, which feed them content in a mishmash of formats, ranging from XML to JSON to preformatted HTML widgets that come with their own styling and look like parasitic growths on the site. An envisioned Nustori publishing system would collect and normalize these data sources into a serialized document to be intelligently transformed and formatted for use on the site.

                    <p>
                        Often, these disparate data sources aren't even external, but are internal to the publisher's own systems. A main website built with Drupal may coexist with a blog built using WordPress, for example. As envisioned, a full Nustori publishing system would be extended by modules and plugins built to provided serialized document output from these legacy CMSes. An envisioned architecture for Nustori publishing is heavily inspired by the publishing archicture I helped design and implement for <a href="http://REI.com">REI.com</a>, building on ideas proven out on a large ecommerce site with multiple use cases and heavy usage.
