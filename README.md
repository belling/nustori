---------------------

Nustori is a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide a long form content experience. This site demonstrates a prerelease proof of concept version of Nustori. Consider this demo site a rough sketch. Download from GitHub.

Unlike the pattern of long form experiences being popularized by The New York Times, Medium, Verge, and others, Nustori is looking to support traditionally visual storytelling forms, by augmenting them with text rather than the other way around.

the origin stori
----------------

Nustori was inspired by a desire to explore long form content presentation, coupled with my perception that small and non-profit media organzations could use a hand in engaging user experience design and web development. However the ultimate goal of the project is to produce a framework that may find uses in other visually-dynamic applications, including ecommerce, narrative storytelling, blogging, and distance learning.
